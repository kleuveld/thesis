%problem statement
Almost two billion people live in states characterized \todo{by who?} as fragile. These fragile states are characterized by weak state capacity, leaving its citizens vulnerable to various shocks, and unable to the benefit from the growing world wide prosperity. \todo{expand}

The key factor that sets apart Fragile States from their more stable counterparts, is the institutional environment \citep{Rodrik2004,Acemoglu2000}. This term is used to describe the rules and norms that shape (economic) life. It covers crucial things such as protection of property rights and equal treatment by the law \citep{Acemoglu2005}. Such good institutions incentivize innovation, which fosters growth. The relationship between institutions and growth does not run in one direction: economic growth allows for better institutions and vice versa. It is possible that countries could enter a virtuous cycle, where improved institutional quality enhances growth, which improved institutional quality.

A possible other avenue for such a virtuous cycle is through social capital. \todo{expand and define relationship w/ trust} Especially in poorer countries, trust plays an important role in facilitating economic activity \citep{Knack1997}. In such countries, trust and social capital may be a substitute for formal institutions to incentivize innovation by providing insurance and securing property rights. However, institutions can also increase cooperative behaviour \cite{Bo2008,Henrich2010}. This implies that countries with either cooperative behaviour or good institutions can enter a virtuous cycle of institutions producing growth and cooperative behaviour; and cooperative behaviour and growth producing quality institutions.

The question on how to enable such a virtuous cycles for fragile states is too large for any one thesis. This thesis aims to provide empirical, micro-level level evidence on how social capital and behaviour mediate development in fragile states. Figure \ref{fig:intro_framework} outlines these concepts. 

I focus on three separate characteristics of Fragile States, that either present risks or opportunities for their development. Firstly, they are frequently settings for violent conflict. SOME STATISTICS MAYBE? Secondly, they are poorly connected to world markets. This leads to a lack of opportunities for exchange and specialization, and underwhelming economic development. Thirdly, Fragile States are large recipients of development aid. The lack of state capacity makes it hard to fulfil citizen's needs for healthcare, education, and services, leading to international donors to attempt and alleviate the resulting humanitarian crises.

As for development, I focus on human rights, and agricultural productivity. MOTIVATE.

The questions this thesis aims to answer are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the relationship between conflict and competitive behaviour? (Chapter \ref{chap:slfootball});
	\item What is the effect of input subsidies on novel technology adoption? (Chapter \ref{chap:n2a_impact});
	\item What is the effect of market access on trusting behaviour (Chapter \ref{chap:cameroontrust}); and,
	\item What are the drivers of sexual and gender-based violence in Eastern Congo (Chapter \ref{chap:congogbv}).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Contribution}
The primary contribution of this thesis lies in the collection of large-scale datasets in fragile states. The amount of data collected in such states has increased over the past decades. Two factors contribute to this increase. On the supply side, cost of data collection is dropping. Information technology allows for cheaper collection and processing of data, and for more effective monitoring of field staff. On the demand side, is a drive to more rigorously evaluate the impact development aid. This necessitates the collection of detailed household-level data to compare project beneficiaries with non-beneficiaries. The primary funding for this PhD-thesis comes from such an evaluation: the MFS II evaluations, commissioned by the Dutch ministry of foreign affairs.

Despite this, citizens of Fragile States remain under-represented in studies on behaviour. Chapter \ref{chap:slfootball} contributes by studying the effects of conflict on youth in Sierra Leone. Chapter \ref{chap:cameroontrust} contributes to this by collecting large-scale data on behaviour of an understudied group: Africans from rural areas, with poor access to markets. Chapter 4 studies the dynamics of sexual violence in Congo. Despite the prominence the topic has had in public discourse on Congo, and despite its severity, little data exists on these dynamics. This is partly due the difficulties and costs inherent in operating in unstable countries.



All data sets used for analyses, and all protocols and analysis scripts are released to the public domain.
