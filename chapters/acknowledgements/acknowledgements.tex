First of all, I would like to thanks Dieudonnee Mundi; without his gracious hospitality the data collection in Congo for this thesis would have been impossible. It is an incredible shame that he will not be able to see the products of these activities.

My family has been important throughout. This includes my parents and brothers, but especially my partner, Aster, who has been supportive of me finally finishing this project. Special thanks are in order for Vanja: even though she is too young to have seen much of the work that has gone in this thesis, she was an enormous inspiration in finishing it.

Science is a team sport, and fortunately the DEC department is filled with great team players. Of great support to me have been my supervisors Maarten and Marrit, and my promotor Erwin. My co-authors have also been a joy to work with. I've spent months in Cameroon with Niccolò, and in Sierra Leone with Maarten and Francesco, all of whom have contributed to more valuable insights than could have possibly been included in a thesis, including thorough (though perhaps not entirely emprically grounded) investigations into the arboreal feeding habits of Choeropsis Liberiensis and into the unexpected relationship between various local species of Cephalophinae, urban crime and inter-city transport within Sierra Leone. I've spent a short time in Bukavu with Janneke and Lonneke, but fortunately more time in the Netherlands. There is many folks at DEC who are not co-authors, but have contributed greatly to the atmosphere that makes it such a good place to work. This includes Zihan, Martha, Paul, Jan, Maria, Landry, Haki, Ian, Rein, Nico, and all others I've spent so much time with during coffee break, group drinks and football games. One more reason DEC is such a great place to work, is the fabulous support staff, who make it possible to navigate the bureacratic maze that the university can be. So big thanks are in order for Marian, Dineke, Gré, and Betty.

During field work, I have had great research assistance from Eva, Evelien, Biho, Imke, Karin, Romy, Alexandra, John and Megan. The field work in Congo ws done in close cooperation with the Université Catholique Bukavu, in particular Janvier and the Université du Graben, where Kennedy has been a great help. I have had even more assistance from interviewers, especially Chance Jacques, Papy, Eustache, Freddy, Raymond, Bakari, Aisha. 

Finally, I have combined finalizing this PhD project with jobs at EDI and the VU. While combining a PhD with a job was difficult at times, my colleagues at both these places have made it a joy.
