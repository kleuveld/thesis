%link back to general themes
The preceding chapters each presented local evidence on development. Each chapter discussed a subset of the of the risks and opportunities that I presented in Chapter \ref{chap:introduction}, and their impact on development, focusing on different countries: Sierra Leone, DRC and Cameroon. Such a local perspective allows me to asses how the effects of these risks and opportunities are mediated through social capital and behaviour, which is important as such mediation may have surprising, or unintuitive consequences for the impacts that these risks and opportunities have on development. In this concluding chapter, I will briefly summarize the findings of each chapter, and then provide a synthesis on how the local perspective has contributed to our understanding of development.

%\section{Conflict and Competitive Behaviour}
At the core of Chapter \ref{chap:slfootball} is the question whether conflict affects competitive behaviour among youths in Eastern Sierra Leone. While conflict is an import risk to development, competitive behaviour may play a role in fostering development. We invited football players from a youth tournament to participate in a post-game research activity comprising a short questionnaire and a number of behavioural experiments. We found that the larger the exposure to conflict a player had seen, the more competitively they behaved in an effort game when matched with players from opposing teams, and the more foul cards they received in the football tournament. This highlights how unexpected the behavioural links between conflict and development can be and points at a potential (minor) upside of conflict to development: it may transform society to become dynamic, and more competitive, thus promoting economic development.

%\section{Subsidies and Technology Adoption}
%What is the effect of input subsidies on novel technology adoption? (Chapter \ref{chap:n2a_impact}
An important component of development is agricultural productivity. However, in Africa this productivity is constrained by low adoption of inputs. Chapter \ref{chap:n2a_impact} revolves around the effectiveness of input subsidization as a way to remove this constraint. The chapter presents evidence from an impact evaluation of a project that provided subsidized input packages (including fertilizer, inoculant and seeds) to smallholder farmers in South Kivu province in the eastern DRC. The results suggest that the project effected an increase in use of both fertilizer and inoculant the year after the subsidized packages were provided. However, we were unable to find any impacts on yields and food security, perhaps because these are harder to measure with any precision. While these results suggest potential for subsidy programs, an important caveat is in place. When comparing the impact in villages that are close to markets to the impact in villages that are not, we find that the positive effects on input adoption is concentrated in villages closest to markets. This suggests that the project's success doesn't exist in a vacuum, but is context dependent. In this specific case, market access is an important enabling factor for the intervention.

%\section{Markets and Trust}
%What is the effect of market access on trusting behaviour (Chapter \ref{chap:n2a_impact}
While Chapter \ref{chap:n2a_impact} suggests an important role for markets in enabling supply of inputs, markets may have more indirect effects on development as well. In  Chapter \ref{chap:cameroontrust} we explore the effects of market exposure on behaviour in an investment game. Specifically, we consider three determinants of sending behaviour in the game (social preferences, expectations and risk preferences) and examine how the effects of these determinants vary between villages with and without market exposure. When considering these determinants across the entire research population, we find that our respondents are strongly motivated by social preferences, but we find no evidence that they are motivated by expectations. In other words, they consider the game an opportunity to transfer money to a fellow villager, rather than an investment opportunity to get money back. However, when separating villages with and without markets, we do find an effect of expectations in the market villages: respondents with market exposure are more likely to see the money sent as an investment. This suggests that the impacts of markets on development goes deeper than providing a mechanism for the efficient allocation of resources. The repeated interactions with (and perhaps dependence on) relative strangers changes the way people behave.

%\section{Drivers of SGBV in DRC}
%What are the drivers of sexual and gender-based violence in Eastern Congo (Chapter \ref{chap:congogbv})
In chapter \ref{chap:congogbv}, I analysed the results from a list experiment, in order to identify potential drivers of SGBV in Eastern Congo.I found high rates of incidence of SGBV: I estimate that 30\% of the women in the sample were the victim of SGBV in the twelve months preceding data collection. I find that incidence rates are higher among women married to higher-status men, among women who have low intra-household bargaining power, and among women with a history of conflict. I find no relation between recent conflict and SGBV victimization. These findings go against the common narrative where SGBV in DRC is framed as ``weapon of war''. While I do find evidence of a link between violent conflict and SGBV, addressing the high incidence rates takes more than an end to violent conflict. A first condition should be to improve the position of women in Congolese society. The fact that women who have attended secondary school are hardly ever victimized by SGBV may point at an effective strategy, but more research is needed to prove a causal link.

%\section{Concluding Remarks}
%Disccussion: are the methods relevant?
A key argument in this dissertation has been the importance of conducting empirical research at the local level. So how do these finding differ from the common wisdom based on national-level experiences? Does our appreciation of the impact that markets, conflict and aid have on development change when assessing it through a local lens? As for conflict, the impact of conflict remains decidedly negative. But at the local level, the findings presented in Chapter \ref{chap:slfootball} complement a growing literature on the behavioural effects of conflict, not all of which are bad. Taken together with earlier findings that conflict increases in-group pro-social behaviour \cite{Bellows2009b,Voors2012,Gilligan2014,Bauer2014} and political engagement \cite{Bellows2009b,Blattman2009a}, our findings suggest that the experience of conflict has some positive effects on development which may be important to post-conflict recovery.

Despite these possible positive impacts on development, conflict remains associated with overwhelmingly negative outcomes. Chapter \ref{chap:congogbv} deals with one such outcome: SGBV. The rampant levels of SGVB place a huge burden on the Congolese people (it is important to note that even though the focus in this thesis is on women, victimization rates among men are high as well \todo{cite}). While it is common to attribute this violence to the conflict, such a narrow framing risks missing the larger problems that persist within Congolese society \citep[see e.g.][]{Autesserre2012a}. The findings presented in Chapter \ref{chap:congogbv} suggest that violence persists long after the conflict has ended, and that in order to prevent violence, the position of women in Congolese society must be improved.

As for markets, their most obvious role in economic development is to improve economic efficiency by decreasing transaction costs \todo{cite me papi}. This is evidenced by the finding in Chapter \ref{chap:n2a_impact} that aid has more impact closer to markets: after all, farmers with good market access can more easily obtain inputs and sell outputs. There is however a different, more subtle effect. Markets increase the number of interactions with strangers, which requires a different set of norms, and a different set of expectations, than dealing with your family and close neighbours. The findings from Chapter \ref{chap:cameroontrust} are one example of the benefits this could have: increased levels of trust between members of the community. This is in line with existing literature on the effect that large-scale societies have on social preferences \citep{Henrich2010}. \todo{cite more} Given that improving market access is already high on the policy agenda, this may not change development policy, but... \todo{but what}

Development aid provides a policy lever with scope for adjustment, unlike conflict (which we try to minimize) and market access (which we try to increase). The evidence presented in Chapter \ref{chap:n2a_impact} suggests that relatively light interventions in difficult areas can have results, even if they are modest. The findings also suggest that the project didn't achieve impact everywhere, suggesting that better targeting is in order. Such targeting can only be effective given good and reliable data. 

By basing development policy In this way, development aid can respond to the unexpected effects that can arise through the interaction of external drivers of development and local factors such as social capital and behaviour.

There are limits to this. The benefits of conflict were small, as were the behavioural effects of market access.
